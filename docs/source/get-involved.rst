Get involved
============

Join conda email group
----------------------

Please feel welcome to join the mailing lists for both 
`Anaconda <https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/anaconda>`_ and 
`Conda <https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/conda>`_, ask questions, 
answer questions, and discuss ways to use conda, requests for new features, and any 
other comments you may have.

Contribute recipes to GitHub
----------------------------

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes is always happy to 
accept new recipes for programs not yet there. Building recipes is described in 
the :doc:`build`. When you build a new conda recipe for a program not yet listed 
in the repository, please use a GitHub pull request to submit it to the repository, 
so that others using that program in the future can reuse it. Recipes are welcome 
for programs that use any license, whether GPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, or any other, and 
all of the recipes in this repository are released into the public domain.

Report a bug
------------

Issues with conda are tracked on GitHub at https://github.com/conda/conda/issues, and 
issues with conda build at https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues. If you find 
a bug, please search to see if it has been reported, and please report it if no one 
else has.

Give us feedback
----------------

Please send feedback about the conda documentation to documentation@continuum.io.
